## Project Setup

This is a C# nuget package, for use with the .NET SDK 6 or 7. As such, the `dotnet` tool will allow you to restore packages and build projects.

## Coding Guidelines

Your IDE should automatically adhere to the style guidelines in the provided `.editorconfig` file. Please try to keep lines under 80 characters long whenever possible.

We try to write tests for our projects to ensure a certain level of quality. We are willing to give you support and guidance if you need help!
